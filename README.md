A simple chat app written in Node.JS using socket.io for sending and delivering messages and MongoDB for storing them.

To test it simply run thes commands: (The MongoDB part will not work, you will need to install it and configure it for that, but the chat will be fully working)
```sh
$ npm install
```
and then 
```
$ node app.js
```
You can access it on http://localhost:8080
